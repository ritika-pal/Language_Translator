<h2> OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to provide an application to the people which will resolve the problem of communication gap between the people due to lack of language’s knowledge. This project aims to recognise voice, to translate the recognised text from one language to another and to read the translated text.</p>

<h2> Dependency</h2>
<p>Language translator application has a web portal for the user interaction and REST Web API for frontend and backend interactions or third party application interactions. There are used very modern frameworks for developing front-end and backend.</p>
<ul>
  <l>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and AJAX : This is the framework used for developing front-end of this application.</l>
